## 1. Microsoft Entra ID (Formerly Azure AD)

### Licence Tiers

| Feature | Free | P1 ($6/user/mo) | P2 ($9/user/mo) |
|---------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Basic SSO, MFA (security defaults) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Conditional Access** | No | Yes | Yes |
| App Proxy (publish on-prem apps) | No | Yes | Yes |
| Dynamic Groups | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** | No | No | Yes |
| **Identity Protection** (risk-based) | No | No | Yes |
| Access Reviews | No | No | Yes |

**P1 is essential for production.** Conditional Access alone justifies it. Enables "require MFA from untrusted networks," "block legacy auth," "require compliant devices."

**P2 for governance-heavy organisations.** PIM (just-in-time admin), Identity Protection, Access Reviews for compliance.

**Tip:** P1 included in Microsoft 365 E3, P2 in E5. No standalone licence needed if users already have these.

### Managed Identities

**Always prefer managed identities over service principals with client secrets.**

| Aspect | Managed Identity | Service Principal + Secret |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Credential management | None (Azure handles rotation) | Manual rotation, leakage risk |
| Security risk | Minimal (no extractable credential) | Secret leakage, forgotten rotation |
| Works with | Azure resources only | Any environment |

- **System-assigned:** Tied to resource lifecycle. Use for 1:1 identity (VM accessing Key Vault).
- **User-assigned:** Independent lifecycle. Use for shared identity (fleet of VMs accessing same storage).
- **Code:** `DefaultAzureCredential` auto-discovers identity at runtime.
- **External systems:** Use Workload Identity Federation (OIDC) for GitHub Actions, on-prem.

### Conditional Access Baseline Policies

Every production tenant should have:

1. **Require MFA for all users** -- non-negotiable.
2. **Block legacy authentication** -- POP3, IMAP, SMTP basic auth bypass MFA.
3. **Require MFA for admin roles** -- Global Admin, Exchange Admin, etc.
4. **Require compliant or hybrid-joined device** -- for sensitive applications.
5. **Block high-risk locations** -- use named locations for trusted networks.
6. **Session controls** -- enforce sign-in frequency based on risk.

### Entra ID B2C

Customer-facing identity (not employee):
- Separate tenant with customisable flows. Social providers + local accounts.
- First 50K MAU free for MFA. $0.00325/auth beyond.

## 2. Azure Key Vault

### SKU Comparison

| Feature | Standard | Premium |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Software-protected keys | Yes | Yes |
| HSM-protected keys (FIPS 140-2 L2) | No | Yes |
| Managed HSM | No | Separate ($3.20/hr per unit) |

### Pricing

- Secret operations: $0.03/10K transactions.
- RSA 2048 key operations: $0.03/10K (Standard) or $1/10K (Premium HSM).
- Typical app with 1M secret reads/month: ~$3.

### Best Practices

1. **Access with managed identity.** Assign Key Vault Secrets User or Crypto User roles via RBAC. No credentials.
2. **RBAC over access policies.** Finer-grained control, integrates with PIM.
3. **Soft-delete + purge protection.** Enabled by default. Retains 7 to 90 days. Essential for DR.
4. **Secret rotation.** Integrate Event Grid + Functions for automatic rotation.
5. **Certificate management.** Auto-renew from DigiCert/GlobalSign. Let's Encrypt via community solutions.
6. **Network restriction.** Private Endpoint + firewall rules in production. Deny public access.
7. **Separate vaults per environment.** Production secrets must never share a vault with dev/test.

### Key Vault References in App Service / Functions

```
@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://myvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/MySecret/)
@Microsoft.KeyVault(VaultName=myvault;SecretName=MySecret)
```

Pulls secret at runtime via managed identity. No secrets in App Settings, ARM templates, or CI/CD.

## 3. Microsoft Defender for Cloud

### Workload Protection Plans

| Plan | Cost (approx) | What It Protects |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Free tier** | $0 | Security recommendations, Secure Score, asset inventory |
| **Defender for Servers P1** | $5/server/mo | MDE integration, FIM |
| **Defender for Servers P2** | $15/server/mo | P1 + vulnerability assessment, JIT access, 500 MB/day logs |
| **Defender for Containers** | $7/vCore/mo | AKS/EKS/GKE runtime, image scanning, admission control |
| **Defender for Storage** | $10/storage acct/mo | Malware scanning, anomaly detection |
| **Defender for SQL** | $15/instance/mo | SQL injection, vulnerability assessment |
| **Defender for Key Vault** | $0.02/10K transactions | Unusual access patterns |
| **Defender CSPM** | $5/server/mo | Attack path analysis, cloud security graph |

**Always enable free tier.** Servers P1 ($5/mo) is cost-effective for MDE integration. Enable selectively by risk profile: Servers and SQL first, then containers, then storage.

Defender for Storage with malware scanning can be expensive for high-volume blob; enable only on accounts receiving external uploads.

### Just-In-Time (JIT) VM Access (P2)

- Locks SSH (22) and RDP (3389) via NSG rules.
- Users request temporary access (1 to 24 hours) to their IP.
- **Alternative:** Azure Bastion for browser-based access without public IPs.

### Azure Bastion

| SKU | Cost/mo | Features |
|-----|---------|----------|
| Developer | ~$5/day (per use) | Single connection, portal only |
| Basic | ~$140 | 25 sessions, portal SSH/RDP |
| Standard | ~$215 | Native client, shareable links, 50 sessions |
| Premium | ~$430 | Session recording, private-only |

Developer for small dev/test. Basic for most production. Standard for native client needs.

## 4. Azure Policy and Governance

### Policy Effects

| Effect | Behaviour | Use Case |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Audit | Log non-compliance | Discovery phase |
| Deny | Block creation/modification | Enforce standards |
| DeployIfNotExists | Auto-remediate | Ensure diagnostics, NSGs exist |
| Modify | Change tags/properties at deploy | Tag enforcement |

### Essential Policies

1. Require tag and value on resource groups (cost allocation).
2. Allowed locations (data sovereignty).
3. Allowed VM size SKUs (prevent expensive N/M-series).
4. Storage accounts disable public access.
5. SQL servers use private endpoints.
6. Key Vault purge protection enabled.
7. AKS no container privilege escalation.

### Policy Initiatives

- **Azure Security Benchmark (ASB):** ~200 policies. Assign to all subscriptions as baseline.
- **CIS Azure Foundations, NIST 800-53, PCI-DSS, HIPAA:** Regulatory frameworks.
- Policy evaluation is free. Remediation may create billable resources.

### Management Groups

```
Root Management Group
├── Platform (Identity, Management, Connectivity)
├── Landing Zones
│   ├── Production (Prod-App1, Prod-App2)
│   └── Non-Production (Dev, Staging)
├── Sandbox (Experimentation)
└── Decommissioned
```

Policies and RBAC cascade to child subscriptions. Use Azure Landing Zones (ALZ) Terraform/Bicep modules for greenfield.

## 5. RBAC

### Critical Built-In Roles

| Role | What It Grants |
|------|---------------|
| Owner | Full control + RBAC assignment. Minimise. |
| Contributor | Full control, no RBAC delegation. |
| Reader | Read-only (not secrets/keys). |
| User Access Administrator | RBAC management only. |

**Prefer resource-specific roles:** `Storage Blob Data Reader`, `Key Vault Secrets User`, `AcrPull`, `SQL DB Contributor`.

### RBAC Best Practices

1. **Assign to groups, not individuals.** Reduces sprawl.
2. **Use PIM (P2) for privileged roles.** Just-in-time for Owner, Global Admin.
3. **Scope narrowly.** Resource group scope, not subscription-wide Contributor.
4. **Audit regularly.** Access Reviews (P2) or periodic manual review.

---

## 6. Network Security Groups (NSGs)

### CIS Azure Foundations Benchmark Rules

The following rules from the CIS Azure Foundations Benchmark are the minimum compliance bar for every NSG:

| Rule | Severity | What It Checks |
|------|----------|----------------|
| 6.1 | Critical | RDP (port 3389) not open to 0.0.0.0/0 from internet |
| 6.2 | Critical | SSH (port 22) not open to 0.0.0.0/0 from internet |
| 6.3 | High | No unrestricted UDP (all ports) from internet |
| 6.4 | Medium | NSG flow logs enabled with 90+ day retention |

### NSG Compliance Audit Workflow

Use this sequence when auditing NSG compliance or checking security posture:

1. **Discover.** List all NSGs; note orphaned ones (no subnet or NIC associations).
2. **Audit.** Run CIS checks against all NSGs (e.g. via `azure_audit_nsg_compliance`).
3. **Deep dive.** For each Critical/High finding: review the full rule set for the affected NSG; identify which subnets/NICs are exposed via their associations.
4. **Effective rules.** For critical NICs: retrieve aggregated effective security rules (e.g. via `azure_get_effective_security_rules`) to account for all associated NSGs combined.
5. **Flow logs.** Check Network Watcher flow log coverage and retention across the subscription.
6. **Report.** Summarise by severity; list affected resources; provide specific remediation steps.

### Incident Response: Suspicious Access

1. Retrieve effective security rules for the target NIC to determine what traffic is permitted.
2. Review the full rule list for each associated NSG to identify which specific rule is permitting traffic.
3. Run a CIS compliance check on the specific NSG to surface any known gaps.
4. Check Network Watcher flow log status; confirm whether the traffic was captured.

### Orphaned NSG Detection

An NSG with no subnet or NIC associations still consumes quota and creates audit noise. Include orphaned NSG identification in every compliance sweep; flag for decommission or re-association review.

## 7. Network Security Hardening

### Zero Trust on Azure

1. **Identity:** Entra ID -- every request authenticated and authorised.
2. **Micro-segmentation:** NSGs + ASGs -- default-deny between subnets.
3. **Private connectivity:** Private Endpoints for all PaaS.
4. **Encryption:** TLS 1.2+ everywhere.
5. **Inspection:** Azure Firewall Premium for TLS inspection, IDPS.
6. **Monitoring:** Defender for Cloud + Sentinel for threat detection.

### Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM/SOAR)

- Pay-as-you-go: ~$2.46/GB/day. 100 GB/day commitment: ~$1.96/GB (20% savings).
- **Free sources:** Azure Activity Logs, Office 365 audit logs, Defender alerts.
- **Cost optimisation:** Filter noise before ingestion. Basic Logs ($0.60/GB) for verbose logs. Archive after 90 days.
- Adopt when you have a dedicated security operations team. Defender alerts + Log Analytics may suffice for smaller teams.
