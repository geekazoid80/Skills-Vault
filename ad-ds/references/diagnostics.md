# AD DS diagnostics and troubleshooting

## Essential diagnostic tools

### dcdiag (Domain Controller Diagnostics)

```powershell
# Run all tests on local DC
dcdiag /v

# Run all tests on all DCs in the domain
dcdiag /v /a

# Run all tests on all DCs in the forest
dcdiag /v /e

# Run specific test
dcdiag /test:replications
dcdiag /test:dns /v
dcdiag /test:fsmocheck
dcdiag /test:ridmanager

# Test specific DC
dcdiag /s:DC01.example.com /v
```

**Key dcdiag tests:**

| Test | What it checks | Common failures |
|---|---|---|
| `Connectivity` | LDAP and RPC connectivity to DC | Firewall blocking, DC offline, DNS failure |
| `Replications` | Replication status and errors | Replication failures, lingering objects |

| `FrsEvent` / `DFSREvent` | SYSVOL replication health | DFS-R conflicts, journal wrap |
| `KccEvent` | KCC topology generation errors | Topology generation failures |
| `MachineAccount` | DC machine account health | Machine account password mismatch |
| `NCSecDesc` | Naming context security descriptors | Permissions issues on NC heads |
| `NetLogons` | Secure channel health | Trust relationship failures |
| `RidManager` | RID pool availability | RID pool depletion |
| `DNS` | DNS infrastructure for AD | Missing DNS records, delegation issues |
| `SystemLog` | Critical system event log errors | Hardware, service, or driver failures |

### repadmin (Replication Diagnostics)

```powershell
# Show replication status summary
repadmin /replsummary

# Show replication partners and status for all DCs
repadmin /showrepl *

# Show replication status for specific DC
repadmin /showrepl DC01.example.com

# Show replication queue
repadmin /queue *

# Force replication from all partners
repadmin /syncall DC01 /A /e /d /P

# Force replication of specific partition from specific partner
repadmin /replicate DC02.example.com DC01.example.com "DC=example,DC=com"

# Show metadata for specific object (useful for conflict resolution)
repadmin /showobjmeta DC01.example.com "CN=User1,OU=Users,DC=example,DC=com"

# Show up-to-dateness vector
repadmin /showutdvec DC01.example.com "DC=example,DC=com"

# Check for lingering objects (advisory mode first)
repadmin /removelingeringobjects DC02.example.com DC01_GUID "DC=example,DC=com" /advisory_mode
```

## Replication troubleshooting

### Common replication error codes

| Error code | Description | Root cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8606 | Insufficient attributes to create object | Lingering objects | `repadmin /removelingeringobjects` |
| 8453 | Replication access denied | Permission issue | Check DC machine account; reset secure channel |
| 8524 | DSA operation unable to proceed | DNS failure | Verify DNS resolution; `_msdcs` zone delegation |
| 1256 | Remote system not available | Network connectivity | Firewall rules, DC offline, NIC issues |
| 1722 | RPC server unavailable | RPC connectivity failure | Check RPC endpoint mapper (port 135); dynamic ports |
| 1908 | Could not find DC for domain | DNS cannot resolve DC | Fix DNS records; check forwarders/root hints |
| 8451 | Replication operation failed due to database error | NTDS.dit corruption | Check disk; run `ntdsutil "semantic database analysis"` |
| 8614 | Replication disabled (tombstone violation) | DC exceeded tombstone lifetime | Remove DC metadata; rebuild from scratch |

### Replication failure workflow

```
1. repadmin /replsummary
   -- Identify which DCs have failures and error counts

2. repadmin /showrepl <failing_DC>
   -- Get specific error codes and last success times

3. Based on error:
   DNS errors (8524, 1908) -> Check DNS resolution
     nslookup <DC_FQDN>
     nslookup -type=SRV _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.<domain>

   RPC errors (1722, 1256) -> Check network/firewall
     Test-NetConnection <DC_IP> -Port 135
     portqry -n <DC_IP> -e 135

   Permission errors (8453) -> Check machine account
     nltest /sc_verify:<domain>
     Reset-ComputerMachinePassword

   Lingering objects (8606) -> Remove lingering objects
     repadmin /removelingeringobjects <dest_DC> <source_DC_GUID> <partition_DN> /advisory_mode
     Review results, then run without /advisory_mode

4. After fixing, force replication:
   repadmin /syncall /A /e /d /P

5. Verify: repadmin /replsummary (should show 0 failures)
```

## DNS troubleshooting for AD

AD DS is critically dependent on DNS. Most AD issues are actually DNS issues.

### Required DNS records

```powershell
# Verify required SRV records exist (registered by Netlogon on each DC)

# Domain controller SRV records
nslookup -type=SRV _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.example.com
nslookup -type=SRV _kerberos._tcp.dc._msdcs.example.com

# Site-specific SRV records
nslookup -type=SRV _ldap._tcp.SiteName._sites.dc._msdcs.example.com

# GC SRV records
nslookup -type=SRV _ldap._tcp.gc._msdcs.example.com

# PDC SRV record
nslookup -type=SRV _ldap._tcp.pdc._msdcs.example.com

# CNAME record for DC GUID
nslookup -type=CNAME <DC-GUID>._msdcs.example.com
```

### Common DNS issues

| Issue | Symptom | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Missing SRV records | Clients cannot find DCs | Restart Netlogon service; check DNS zone permissions |
| Stale DNS records | Clients connect to decommissioned DCs | Enable DNS scavenging (7/7 day aging/scavenging) |
| Wrong DNS server on DC | Replication failures | DC must point to itself or another DC for DNS, never an external resolver |
| Missing `_msdcs` zone | Forest-wide service location fails | Re-create the delegated `_msdcs` zone |
| DNS zone not AD-integrated | Zone replication independent of AD replication | Convert to AD-integrated for unified replication |

### DNS health check

```powershell
# Full DNS test via dcdiag
dcdiag /test:dns /v /e

# Check DNS registration
ipconfig /registerdns

# Verify zone SRV contents
Get-DnsServerResourceRecord -ZoneName "example.com" -RRType SRV | Where-Object {$_.HostName -like "_ldap*"}

# Check forwarders
Get-DnsServerForwarder
```

## Authentication failure troubleshooting

### Account lockout investigation

```powershell
# Find lockout source (run on PDC Emulator)
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security';Id=4740} |
    Select-Object TimeCreated, @{N='User';E={$_.Properties[0].Value}},
    @{N='Source';E={$_.Properties[1].Value}}

# Check lockout status
Get-ADUser -Identity jdoe -Properties LockedOut,AccountLockoutTime,BadLogonCount,BadPasswordTime,LastBadPasswordAttempt

# Unlock account
Unlock-ADAccount -Identity jdoe

# Check lockout policy
Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy
```

### Kerberos troubleshooting

```powershell
# View cached Kerberos tickets
klist

# Purge Kerberos tickets (force re-authentication)
klist purge

# Check for duplicate SPNs (causes KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED)
setspn -X

# Enable Kerberos operational log
wevtutil set-log "Microsoft-Windows-Kerberos-Key-Distribution-Center/Operational" /enabled:true

# Event 4776 on DC indicates NTLM authentication; investigate why Kerberos was not used
```

### Trust relationship failures

```powershell
# Verify trust
Get-ADTrust -Filter * | Select-Object Name,Direction,TrustType,IntraForest

# Test trust
Test-ComputerSecureChannel -Server DC01.trusted.com -Verbose

# Verify trust authentication
nltest /sc_verify:trusted.com

# Repair trust
netdom trust example.com /domain:trusted.com /reset /passwordt:* /usero:admin /passwordo:*
```

## Performance diagnostics

### NTDS performance counters

| Counter | Healthy value | Investigate if |
|---|---|---|
| `NTDS\LDAP Searches/sec` | Varies (baseline first) | Unexpected spikes; identify expensive queries |
| `NTDS\LDAP Successful Binds/sec` | Varies | High values may indicate brute force |
| `Database\Database Cache % Hit` | Greater than 95% | Below threshold: add RAM or investigate cache pressure |
| `NTDS\DRA Inbound Bytes Total/sec` | Varies | Spikes indicate large replication events |
| `NTDS\ATQ Threads LDAP` | Below max threads | Thread exhaustion indicates overloaded DC |

### Expensive LDAP query detection (Event 1644)

```powershell
# Enable via registry on DC
# HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTDS\Diagnostics
# Set "15 Field Engineering" = 5
# Set "Expensive Search Results Threshold" = 10000  (DWORD)
# Set "Inefficient Search Results Threshold" = 1000  (DWORD)
# Set "Search Time Threshold (msecs)" = 100         (DWORD)

# Event ID 1644 in Directory Service log shows expensive/inefficient LDAP query details
```

## Backup and recovery scenarios

| Scenario | Approach | Commands |
|---|---|---|
| Deleted user or OU (Recycle Bin enabled) | Restore from Recycle Bin | `Get-ADObject -Filter {isDeleted -eq $true} -IncludeDeletedObjects | Restore-ADObject` |
| Deleted user or OU (no Recycle Bin) | Authoritative restore from backup | Boot to DSRM; restore System State; `ntdsutil "authoritative restore"` |
| Corrupted DC | Non-authoritative restore or rebuild | Restore System State or demote/re-promote |
| Total AD loss | Forest recovery | Microsoft forest recovery procedure: isolate, restore DCs per domain, verify, reconnect |
| FSMO role holder failed | Seize role | `Move-ADDirectoryServerOperationMasterRole -Identity DC02 -OperationMasterRole PDCEmulator -Force` |
